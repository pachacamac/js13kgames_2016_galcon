# js13kgames_2016_glitchcon

A glitchy (that's the theme of the competition) version of Galcon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galcon) for js13kgames.

Hacked together due to lack of time. Basically this was done in a couple hours. Always liked the simple game concept behind Galcon and always wanted to try and hack my own shitty version. Then I added some glitchiness and it gave the game a surprising new twist. In random intervals the ownerships of the planets change, therefore it's way harder to strategize as you basically have to play both sides and wait for the right moment to make a quick deadly attack before chaos strikes again!

Everything including levels and sounds is procedurally generated.

Oh and you're playing against a simple but mean "AI". You're green and your opponent is red. Now try to conquer the galaxy in this glitchy chaos!!! 

Tested in FF and Chrome on Linux and Android.
